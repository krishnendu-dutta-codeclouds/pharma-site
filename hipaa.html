                </p>



                <p>When this Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) refers to “we” or “us,” it is referring to MDMEDICA
                    LLC and all the pharmacists who provide health care services and the employees of our pharmacy. We
                    are required by law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information (“PHI”), to follow
                    the terms of the Notice currently in effect, to give you this Notice setting forth our legal duties

                    explains the rights you have with respect to your PHI, and certain obligations we must abide by in
                    accordance with the law. We reserve the right to amend this Notice. If we make any material

                <h3>I. Use and disclosure of your PHI</h3>



                <p>We will use and disclose your PHI for treatment, payment and health care operations. We may also use
                    your PHI for other purposes that are permitted and/or required by law and pursuant to your written
                    authorization. The following lists examples of how we may use and/or disclose your PHI. Any other
                    uses not described in this Notice will only be made with your explicit written authorization, which
                    you may revoke at any time by providing us with written notice of your revocation.</p>



                <p>A.&nbsp;Treatment&nbsp;– We may use and disclose your PHI in order to provide you with prescription
                    and supply services. We may disclose your PHI to other pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and health
                    care providers that are involved in your care. You will receive an individual notice and have the
                    opportunity to opt out of any subsidized treatment communications.</p>
                <p>B.&nbsp;Payment&nbsp;– We will use and disclose your PHI in order to obtain payment for the health
                    care services we provide to you. We may also need to disclose your PHI to receive prior approval
                    from your health plan or to determine if your health plan will cover a certain prescription or
                    service.</p>
                <p>C.&nbsp;Health care operations&nbsp;– We may use and disclose your PHI in connection with the
                    management of our pharmacy. For example, this may include: quality assessment and improvement,
                    internal compliance audits, and performance evaluations. Additionally, we may use your PHI for our
                    business management and general administrative activities.</p>
                <p>D.&nbsp;Prescription refill reminders, treatment alternatives or health-related benefits&nbsp;– We
                    may use and disclose your PHI to contact you to remind you about prescription refills, to tell you
                    about treatment options or alternatives, or to inform you about health-related benefits or services
                    that may be of interest to you.</p>
                <p>E.&nbsp;Family members, relatives or close friends&nbsp;– Unless you object to such disclosure, we
                    may disclose your PHI to your family members, relatives or close personal friends, or any other
                    persons identified by you as being involved in the treatment or payment for your medical care. If
                    you are not present to agree or object to our disclosure of your PHI to a family member, relative or
                    friend, we may exercise our professional judgment to determine whether the disclosure is in your
                    best interest. If we decide to disclose your PHI, we will only disclose the PHI that is relevant to
                    your treatment or payment.</p>
                <p>F.&nbsp;Other permitted and required uses and disclosures&nbsp;– We may use your PHI without

                <h3>II. Your rights as our patient</h3>



                <p>As our patient, you have a number of rights associated with your PHI. The following describes your
                    specific rights.</p>



                <p>A. You have the right to request restrictions or limitations on how we use and/or disclose your PHI,
                    however, we do not have to agree to your requested restriction or limitation (except for
                    transactions you paid for in full out-of-pocket). Your written request must specify: (1) if you
                    would like to restrict or limit our use and/or disclosure; (2) what information you want restricted
                    or limited; and (3) to whom the restriction or limitation applies (e.g., spouse). If we agree to
                    your request, it will not prevent us from disclosing your PHI as follows: (1) to you if you request
                    access or an accounting of disclosures; (2) for purposes required or permitted by law; or (3) in
                    case of an emergency.</p>



                <p>B. You have the right to receive confidential communications concerning your PHI by alternative means
                    or via alternative locations. For example, you may want to receive communications related to your
                    prescriptions at a different address other than your home address. If you wish to receive
                    confidential communications via alternative means or locations, please submit your request in
                    writing to the Privacy Officer and set forth the alternative means by which you wish to receive
                    communications or the alternative location at which you wish to receive such communications. We will
                    accommodate all reasonable requests.</p>



                <p>C. You have the right to access, inspect and obtain a copy of your PHI, including any electronic PHI;
                    provided, however, you are not entitled to access certain PHI exempted under HIPAA. To the extent we
                    maintain electronic PHI, upon request we will provide you with a copy of your PHI in the format
                    requested. If we do not have your PHI in our possession, we will provide you with the appropriate
                    contact information when your request is received. If you request a copy of your PHI, you will
                    receive a response to your request in a timely fashion but may be charged a reasonable, cost-based
                    fee to cover copy costs and postage. In some limited circumstances, we may deny your request for
                    access to PHI in which case you may request for the denial to be reviewed. If access is ultimately
                    denied, you are entitled to a written explanation with the reason(s) for the denial.</p>



                <p>D. You have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of your PHI made by us, including
                    disclosures to or by our business associate(s), for a period of six (6) years prior to the date on
                    which you request an accounting of disclosures, or such lesser period as you indicate. You will
                    receive one request annually free of charge and, thereafter, we may charge you a reasonable,
                    cost-based fee for each subsequent request for an accounting of disclosures within the same
                    twelve-month period. We will notify you of the cost for an accounting of disclosures and you may
                    choose to withdraw or modify your request before we charge you.</p>



                <p>E. If you believe we have PHI about you that is incorrect or incomplete, you may make a written
                    request to us stating the reasons to support any requested amendment. You have the right to request
                    an amendment to your PHI for so long as we maintain your PHI. If we do not have your PHI in our
                    possession, we will provide you with the appropriate contact information when we receive your
                    request. We will respond to your request for an amendment after we receive your request. However, we
                    may deny your request for amendment if, for example, we determine that the PHI you requested was not
                    created by us or is already accurate and complete. You may respond to our denial by filing a written
                    statement of disagreement, but we have the right to rebut your disagreement. If this occurs, you
                    have the right to request that your original request, our denial, your statement of disagreement,
                    and our rebuttal be included in future disclosures of your PHI.</p>



                <p>F. You have the right at any time to obtain a paper copy of this Notice, even if you receive this
                    Notice electronically. If you have received an electronic copy of this Notice but wish to obtain a
                    paper copy of this Notice, please send your request in writing to the Privacy Officer at the address
                    listed below.</p>



                <p>G. You have the right to opt-out of fundraising and your PHI will not be used for fundraising
                    purposes or sold without your prior authorization.</p>



                <h3>III. Additional information/questions or complaints</h3>



                <p>A. If you need any additional information about this Notice or wish to exercise any of your rights
