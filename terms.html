                    PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>



                <h3>Indemnification</h3>



                <p>YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS COMPANY AND ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,

                    APPLICABLE LAWS, (B) YOUR MISUSE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, AND (C) YOUR BREACH OF THESE TERMS OR ANY
                    OTHER TERMS ON THE SITE. WE RESERVE, AND YOU GRANT TO US, THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE DEFENSE

                <h3>Dispute resolution</h3>



                <p>You agree to use the dispute resolution procedures set forth herein with respect to any controversy
                    or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or their breach. Any dispute between you
                    and Company arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use will be settled by a binding
                    arbitration in San Diego, California, in accordance with the then-current rules and procedures of
                    Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS). The arbitrator will apply the law in
                    accordance with the laws of the State of California. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that, any provision of
                    law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will have the authority to award the prevailing party its costs
                    and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Any disputes between you and other users of this Site are not the
                    responsibility of the Company.</p>

                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Use, in whole or in part, at our own discretion at any
                    time. Modifications shall be effective immediately upon the linking of modified Terms of Use to the
                    Site. Please check the “last updated” date at the top of this page to determine if these Terms of
                    Use have been modified since you last reviewed them. Your continued use of the Site after that date
                    means you agree to these updated Terms of Use.</p>

                <h3>Severability</h3>



                <p>If an arbitrator or legal authority determines that any part of these Terms of Use is illegal or
                    unenforceable, then such part will be eliminated, and the remaining Terms of Use will remain in
                    force and effect and continue to apply to your use of the Site and our Services.</p>

                <h3>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Notice</h3>



                <p>In operating the Site, we may act as a “services provider” (as defined by DMCA) and offer services as
                    an online provider of materials and links to third party websites. As a result, third party
                    materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored, accessed or otherwise made
                    available while using the Site. MDMEDICA.COM has in place certain legally mandated procedures
                    regarding allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Site. We have adopted a policy that
                    provides for the immediate removal of any content or the suspension of any user that is found to
                    have infringed on the rights of MDMEDICA.COM or of a third party, or that has otherwise violated any
                    intellectual property laws or regulations, or any of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.
                    If you believe any material available via the Site or Services infringes, specifically or generally
                    upon a copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for claimed infringement under the
                    DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We will respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the
                    material claimed to be infringing upon said copyright and will follow the procedures specified in
                    the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the
                    content. We may give notice to our users of any infringement notice by means of a general notice on
                    any of our websites, electronic mail to a user’s e-mail address in our records, or by written
                    communication sent by first-class mail to a user’s physical address in our records. If you receive
                    such an infringement notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to the designated agent
                    that includes the information below. Our designated agent (i.e., proper party for notice) to whom
                    you should address infringement notices under the DMCA is <a
                        href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#12616762627d6066527f767f77767b71733c717d7f"><span

                </p>

                <p>Consent to arbitration. IF EITHER YOU OR MDMEDICA LLC WANT TO BRING A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
                    AGAINST THE OTHER UNDER AN AGREEMENT, OR IF ANY DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS A RESULT OF AN
                    AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE OFFERINGS, EACH PARTY AGREES TO USE ARBITRATION AS THE SOLE AND
                    EXCLUSIVE MEANS TO BRING SUCH A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION OR TO RESOLVE SUCH A DISPUTE. YOU
                    UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE FOREGOING AND THE MORE SPECIFIC ARBITRATION TERMS BELOW, EACH OF
                    YOU AND MDMEDICA LLC ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO FORM OR BE A PART OF A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER
                    REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT. YOU ARE NOT, HOWEVER, WAIVING YOUR ABILITY TO RECOVER DAMAGES. ALTHOUGH
                    ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE DIFFERENT FROM COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY
                    THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THAT AWARD MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN
                    ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.</p>

                <p>Class Action Waiver YOU AND MDMEDICA LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                    LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
                    OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
                    MDMEDICA LLC agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and
                    may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If for any reason
                    the class action waiver set forth above cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then
                    the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered
                    by any deemed unenforceable class action waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of
                    competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and
                    enforceable. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the
                    arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.</p>
